In React Router Dom v6, a common mistake is incorrectly using the `useParams` hook.  If you forget to wrap your component using the `Routes` component, and instead directly use the `<Route path='...' element={<MyComponent />} />` syntax outside the `<Routes>` tag, it will lead to unexpected behavior.  The `useParams` hook will not work correctly, returning `undefined` for all parameters. This is because the routes are not properly registered within the routing context provided by `Routes`. Another issue is not setting up correct nesting of routes causing incorrect matching and failure to render the child component.  Incorrect usage of the `Navigate` component with bad paths or not correctly handling redirect after login can also create bugs.
